### Division of Work:
Overall Ideation and design decisions were made collaboratively after thorough discussions. After coming up with the storyline, necessary dataset hunting as well as data preprocessing were divided up between the members. 

Yo-whan was in charge of the choropleth maps, beeswarm chart, and multi-line charts. Most of the HTML/CSS implementations were done by him as well. Hyeyoung was in charge of the bar race graph, and top-risk factor line chart. She also designed and carried out user studies, with results noted in the final paper. 

After producing alpha-versions of the visualizations, each member cross-checked and debugged the other’s implementation for further improvements. Each member wrote about the implementations he/she was in charge of for the paper, but the rest of the paper was divided up equally. 



### Research/Development Process Commentary:
Our group initially wanted to investigate the correlation between Wallstreetbet posts (and their sentiments) and stock prices, but after our exploratory data analysis, we weren't able to find a strong enough correlation to create a visualization about. We switched to the topic above after about a week and a half into the project, but we were quickly captivated by our new topic after noticing obesity’s unexpected trends and risk potentials via initial data analysis.

As noted in our A4 assignment, we were both new to D3/javascript and front-end programming in general. Although we still had to learn many new necessary skills to create this final project, we believe we were mostly prepared for the final project after A4, and thus, were able to focus more on the content and design aspects of the visualizations than the mere implementation. 

We closely examined the peer reviews to look for further improvements on the visualizations, and we thank our reviewers for thoughtful comments that helped us improve upon the MVP. We would also like to thank the teaching staff for captivating lectures, informative workshops, and constructive feedback, which have allowed us to create this final project.
